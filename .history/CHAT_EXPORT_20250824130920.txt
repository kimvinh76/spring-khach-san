[User] (initial): a đi bạn,sửa triệt để cho chạy api dùm tôi nha
[Assistant] Plan: inspect code, run app, fix mappings, add validations, etc.

[Assistant actions & notes]
- Implemented payment subsystem (Payment entity/service, provider interface, mock provider, webhook controller), wired frontend payment form (`form.html`) with fetch POST `/api/payments/initiate` including CSRF + credentials.
- Diagnosed initial 404: old/stale server process still running, responding to requests (static resource). Confirmed controller mapping exists (TRACE logs showed POST /api/payments/initiate).
- User stopped old process; after restart got HTTP 500 on initiate.
- Investigated 500 cause: missing booking test helper, missing booking validation and error handling in `PaymentApiController`.

[Code edits applied during session]
- Added `BookingService.createSampleBookingForTest()` to create a minimal booking used by tests.
  File: src/main/java/com/example/demo/service/BookingService.java

- Hardened `PaymentApiController`:
  - Injected BookingService.
  - Added validation of booking existence and request fields.
  - Wrapped `paymentService.createPayment` and provider `createCheckout` calls with try/catch returning structured error JSON (error codes: missing_fields, booking_not_found, create_payment_failed, provider_checkout_failed).
  - Tidy: extracted constants and helper methods, reduced cognitive complexity.
  - Added dev endpoints for testing:
    - POST/GET `/api/payments/dev/create-sample-booking` -> returns {"bookingId": id}
    - GET `/api/payments/dev/initiate?bookingId=...&amount=...` -> calls initiate for quick browser testing (dev only)
  File: src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/PaymentApiController.java

- Minor refactors and linter fixes.

[Terminal runs / commands executed]
- ./mvnw -q -DskipTests package
- netstat -ano | grep 8086 || true  (note: on Windows `findstr` is preferable)
- ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments='-Dserver.port=8086' (failed earlier due to port 8086 in use)
- ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments='-Dserver.port=8090' (app started on 8090)
- curl probes and python small HTTP probes (some environments didn't have curl available)
- Started app on multiple ports for testing (8090, 8091, 8092) while diagnosing port conflict
- Final attempts: freed port 8086 and started app on 8086 (some runs initially failed due to port still in use; later run succeeded when port was free)

[Observed logs snippets]
- TRACE RequestMappingHandlerMapping showed mapping: {POST [/api/payments/initiate]}: initiate(InitiateRequest)
- Common startup warning: "Port 8086 was already in use" during earlier runs
- Later successful startup: Tomcat initialized with port 8090 / 8091 / 8092 in several tests; then finally Tomcat initialized with port 8086 when port freed.

[Frontend integration]
- `src/main/resources/templates/khachhang/payment/form.html` contains JS that intercepts `.payment-form` submits and calls POST '/api/payments/initiate' with credentials: 'same-origin' and X-CSRF-TOKEN header when present.
- Because JS uses relative path '/api/payments/initiate', the frontend must be served from same origin/port as backend (or JS must be updated to call absolute API URL if backend port differs).
- Added dev GET endpoints to help browser testing without POST client.

[User reported errors and assistant diagnosis]
- Whitelabel 404 initially because old process served request.
- After resolving port, 500 occurred: root cause was missing booking helper + no booking validation; code updated to return 400 booking_not_found instead of 500.
- User later saw Whitelabel 405: they accessed POST-only endpoint via GET; assistant added GET dev endpoint for convenience and explained the mismatch.

[Files created/edited]
- SESSION_EXPORT.txt (session summary)
- CHAT_EXPORT.txt (this full transcript)
- src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/PaymentApiController.java (edits: validation, helpers, dev endpoints)
- src/main/java/com/example/demo/service/BookingService.java (createSampleBookingForTest)

[How to reproduce / recommended steps]
1. Ensure no process holds port 8086:
   netstat -ano | findstr :8086
   taskkill /PID <pid> /F
2. Start app on 8086:
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments='-Dserver.port=8086'
3. Create sample booking (dev):
   http://localhost:8086/api/payments/dev/create-sample-booking
4. Initiate payment (dev):
   http://localhost:8086/api/payments/dev/initiate?bookingId=<id>&amount=100000&method=card&provider=mock
5. For real frontend: open frontend on http://localhost:8086 and use the payment form (it uses POST to /api/payments/initiate with CSRF token).

[Security note]
- Dev GET endpoints are intended for local/manual testing only. Remove or protect before production.
