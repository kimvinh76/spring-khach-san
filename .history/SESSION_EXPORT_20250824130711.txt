Summary:
- Goal: Fix payment API POST /api/payments/initiate so frontend form works; remove 404/500 and ensure stable runtime on port 8086.
- Stack: Spring Boot 3.5.4, Java 17, PostgreSQL, JPA, Thymeleaf.

Work performed (high level):
- Implemented Payment subsystem (controller, service, provider interface, mock provider).
- Added booking test helper: BookingService.createSampleBookingForTest().
- Hardened PaymentApiController: validate booking exists, catch/create payment errors, lookup provider bean, catch provider errors, save providerRef, return structured JSON errors.
- Added dev endpoints to ease manual testing:
  - POST/GET /api/payments/dev/create-sample-booking -> returns {"bookingId": id}
  - GET /api/payments/dev/initiate -> triggers initiate for quick browser checks (dev-only)
- Refactored initiate() to reduce cognitive complexity and constants.

Important files changed:
- src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/PaymentApiController.java (validation, error handling, dev endpoints)
- src/main/java/com/example/demo/service/BookingService.java (createSampleBookingForTest)

Key commands run during session (selected):
- ./mvnw -q -DskipTests package
- ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments='-Dserver.port=8090'
- ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments='-Dserver.port=8091'
- ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments='-Dserver.port=8092'
- ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments='-Dserver.port=8086'
- netstat/findstr used to inspect port 8086.

Runtime status observed:
- Port 8086 was initially in use by a stale process; caused 404 from old instance.
- App successfully ran on alternative ports (8090, 8091, 8092) for testing.
- Final attempt to start on 8086: port still in use initially, then later started successfully after freeing the port (logs show Tomcat initialized on 8086 but some earlier attempts failed with "Port 8086 was already in use").

Frontend integration notes:
- The payment form JS posts to '/api/payments/initiate' (relative URL), so frontend must be served from same origin/port as backend (or use absolute URL to API port).
- If you keep the app on 8092 for testing, update the form JS or open the frontend from same origin.
- Dev endpoints allow creating a booking and initiating payment from browser for quick testing.

How to reproduce test locally (recommended):
1) Ensure no process holds 8086 (Windows):
   netstat -ano | findstr :8086
   taskkill /PID <pid> /F
2) Start app on 8086:
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments='-Dserver.port=8086'
3) Create sample booking (browser):
   http://localhost:8086/api/payments/dev/create-sample-booking
4) Initiate payment (browser quick test):
   http://localhost:8086/api/payments/dev/initiate?bookingId=<id>&amount=100000&method=card&provider=mock
5) For real frontend flow, open the site on http://localhost:8086 and use the payment form (it does POST /api/payments/initiate with CSRF token).

Notes & next steps:
- Remove or secure /dev endpoints before production.
- Consider adding unit/integration tests covering initiate happy path and error cases.
- If you want, I can remove dev GET endpoints and keep only POST API; or revert to run-once script to free 8086 automatically.
